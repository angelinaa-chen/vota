## Description

With the 2024 presidential election – a historical and critical event – coming up in less than a month, we noticed that there was a surplus of election information on the internet, but a lack of organization. At a more targeted level, even less people are informed about their state senators and representatives, despite their direct impact on voting issues. To address this issue we created Vota, which aims to centralize representative information for voters – helping to streamline the process of making informed election decisions.

## Usage

At the bottom of our homepage, users are prompted to enter their hometown state abbreviation:

Upon entering a valid state abbreviation (in this case, Indiana), users are sent to a page displaying a list of state representatives and senators of the specificed state.

For each representative, you can learn more about their party affiliation, district number, respective chamber, and start year.

Additionally, a (very bare-bones) chatbot is also provided to ask additional questions pertaining to representatives, voting, and election information, which aims to answer any questions that may arise.

Through these functionalities, we hope to provide an easily accessible and centralized method of learning about state representatives and elections! :)
